In this second assignment, we perform the below-mentioned tasks:
* Design a VAE on the Fashion MNIST dataset;
* Design a ***GAN*** on the MNIST dataset;
* Design a ***conditional GAN*** on the MNIST dataset

The GAN variant we implement is a deep convolutional GAN. A good introduction can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html).
