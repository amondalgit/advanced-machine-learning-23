In this first assignment, we perform the below-mentioned four tasks on the Fashion MNIST and the Sign Languages dataset:
* Design and train a fully connected neural network;
* Design and train a convolutional neural network;
* Evaluate model performance after scrambling the images; and
* Implement the FGSM attack on both neural networks.
